## BookingBot
This booking bot has been very useful when needing to make appointments. This bot works for websites that constantly update and show their free appointments.
It will refresh every few seconds and see if there is an appointment that fits the conditions of when you are free and once found, fill out your details and book that appointment.

## CryptoPriceScraper
This was just an experiment to see if I could notify when a price had reached a certain level. Additions to this would be adding a message to my phone.
